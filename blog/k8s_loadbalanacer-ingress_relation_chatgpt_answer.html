icon-link"></span></a>in k8s, how is related Ingress and LoadBalancer(Service Resource)? explain detailes in context of nginx-ingress-controller</h2><p>In Kubernetes (k8s), the Ingress and LoadBalancer resources are both used to expose services externally and enable access from outside the cluster. However, they serve different purposes and have different functionalities.</p><ol><li><p>LoadBalancer: The LoadBalancer service type is responsible for providing a stable, externally accessible IP address for a service. It is often used in cloud environments, such as AWS, GCP, or Azure, where a cloud provider&#x27;s load balancer is automatically provisioned. When you create a LoadBalancer service, the cloud provider allocates an external IP address and routes incoming traffic to the corresponding service within the cluster. LoadBalancer services can balance traffic across multiple pods running the same service.</p></li><li><p>Ingress: Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services in a cluster. It acts as a layer 7 (application layer) load balancer and provides advanced routing capabilities based on hostnames, paths, or other HTTP/HTTPS attributes. An Ingress controller, such as the nginx-ingress-controller, is required to implement the Ingress functionality. The Ingress controller is responsible for receiving external traffic, inspecting the HTTP requests, and forwarding them to the appropriate services based on the rules defined in the Ingress resource.</p></li></ol><p>To use the nginx-ingress-controller with Kubernetes, you typically follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Deploy the nginx-ingress-controller: You deploy the nginx-ingress-controller as a separate pod or deployment in your cluster. This controller monitors the Kubernetes API for Ingress resources and configures the underlying nginx server accordingly.</p></li><li><p>Create an Ingress resource: You define an Ingress resource that specifies the rules for routing external traffic to your services. For example, you can define rules based on hostnames or paths.</p></li><li><p>Ingress Controller Configuration: You may need to configure the nginx-ingress-controller with additional settings specific to your deployment. This can include SSL/TLS termination, load balancing algorithms, or custom nginx configurations.</p></li><li><p>LoadBalancer (optional): If your Kubernetes cluster is running in a cloud environment that supports external load balancers, the nginx-ingress-controller can take advantage of it by creating a LoadBalancer service. This LoadBalancer service provisioned by the cloud provider receives external traffic and routes it to the nginx-ingress-controller, which then uses the Ingress resource to forward traffic to the appropriate services within the cluster.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, the LoadBalancer service is responsible for providing an external IP address and distributing traffic across a set of pods, while the Ingress resource, in combination with an Ingress controller like nginx-ingress-controller, enables more advanced routing and load balancing capabilities at the layer 7 level, based on HTTP attributes. The Ingress controller configures the underlying nginx server to handle the traffic based on the rules defined in the Ingress resource. The use of a LoadBalancer service with the Ingress controller is optional and depends on the specific requirements and environment.</p><h2 id="using-metallb-as-loadbalancer-and-nginx-as-ingress-controller-how-user-request-processed-in-the-configuration"><a href="#using-metallb-as-loadbalancer-and-nginx-as-ingress-controller-how-user-request-processed-in-the-configuration" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>using MetalLB as LoadBalancer, and nginx as Ingress-controller, how user request processed in the configuration?</h2><p>When using MetalLB as the LoadBalancer and nginx as the Ingress controller, the processing of a user request follows a specific flow within the Kubernetes cluster. Let&#x27;s go through the steps involved:</p><ol><li><p>User sends a request: A user initiates an HTTP/HTTPS request to access an application or service hosted in the Kubernetes cluster. This request typically includes a hostname and a specific path or URL.</p></li><li><p>MetalLB LoadBalancer: MetalLB is responsible for allocating an external IP address and forwarding incoming traffic to the appropriate components in the cluster. When MetalLB receives the user request, it examines the destination IP and port to determine the appropriate action.</p></li><li><p>Ingress Controller (nginx): If the destination IP and port match an external IP assigned by MetalLB, the request is forwarded to the nginx Ingress controller. The nginx Ingress controller runs as a pod or deployment within the cluster and is responsible for managing the Ingress resources and configuring the underlying nginx server.</p></li><li><p>Ingress Resource: The nginx Ingress controller examines the incoming request and checks the Ingress resources defined in Kubernetes. The Ingress resource contains rules that define how incoming requests should be routed to specific services within the cluster based on hostnames, paths, or other HTTP/HTTPS attributes.</p></li><li><p>Routing and Load Balancing: The nginx Ingress controller applies the rules defined in the Ingress resource to determine the target service for the user request. It selects the appropriate backend service or services based on the configured rules. This can involve host-based routing, path-based routing, or other custom rules.</p></li><li><p>Service Communication: Once the nginx Ingress controller identifies the target service(s) for the user request, it forwards the request to the corresponding service(s) within the cluster. The request is load balanced across the available instances of the service, ensuring scalability and high availability.</p></li><li><p>Service Pods: The service pods receive the forwarded request from the nginx Ingress controller. The application running in the pods processes the request and generates a response.</p></li><li><p>Response Flow: The response generated by the application running in the pods follows the reverse path. It is sent back to the nginx Ingress controller, which, in turn, forwards it back to the user through MetalLB.</p></li></ol><p>By combining MetalLB as the LoadBalancer and nginx as the Ingress controller, the user request is effectively routed from the external network to the appropriate services within the Kubernetes cluster, and the response is sent back to the user, completing the communication flow.</p><h2 id="in-the-diagram-i-saw-when-i-was-learning-about-metallb-the-metallb-is-responsible-for-exposing-a-public-port-in-front-of-the-ingresscontroller-to-forward-external-requests-to-the-ingresscontroller"><a href="#in-the-diagram-i-saw-when-i-was-learning-about-metallb-the-metallb-is-responsible-for-exposing-a-public-port-in-front-of-the-ingresscontroller-to-forward-external-requests-to-the-ingresscontroller" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>In the diagram I saw when I was learning about metalLB, the metalLB is responsible for exposing a public port in front of the IngressController to forward external requests to the IngressController.</h2><p>But in the real world, metalLBs are deployed inside the cluster. Why? The LBs provided by cloud providers are deployed outside the cluster, which I think is a worse practice. What do you think?</p><p>You&#x27;re correct that in the diagram you mentioned, MetalLB is shown exposing a public port in front of the Ingress Controller to forward external requests. However, in real-world deployments, MetalLB is typically deployed inside the cluster, and the load balancer IP addresses provided by MetalLB are internal IP addresses within the cluster&#x27;s network.</p><p>The reason for deploying MetalLB inside the cluster is to enable the use of on-premises or bare-metal infrastructure, where external load balancers may not be readily available or feasible to use. MetalLB acts as a software-based load balancer that provides load balancing capabilities within the cluster itself.</p><p>While cloud providers typically offer their own load balancer solutions that are deployed outside the cluster, using them may not always be the best practice or feasible in certain environments. Here are a few reasons why deploying LBs outside the cluster may not always be preferred:</p><ol><li><p>Infrastructure Constraints: In on-premises or bare-metal environments, external load balancers may not be available or compatible with the existing infrastructure. Deploying a software load balancer like MetalLB inside the cluster allows for more flexibility and compatibility.</p></li><li><p>Network Efficiency: Placing the load balancer inside the cluster avoids the need for traffic to traverse external networks. This can improve network efficiency and reduce latency, especially when the cluster and external load balancers are in separate locations.</p></li><li><p>Security Considerations: In certain security-sensitive environments, organizations may prefer to keep their cluster and load balancer infrastructure separate. Deploying MetalLB inside the cluster allows for tighter control over network access and reduces potential attack vectors.</p></li><li><p>Portability and Vendor Lock-In: Using a software load balancer like MetalLB promotes portability across different infrastructure providers. It enables the cluster to be deployed on various platforms without being tightly coupled to a specific vendor&#x27;s load balancer solution.</p></li></ol><p>However, it&#x27;s worth noting that the choice of load balancer deployment depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the environment. In some cases, using external load balancers provided by cloud providers may be the preferred option, especially when utilizing managed Kubernetes services in the cloud.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision of deploying load balancers inside or outside the cluster depends on factors such as infrastructure availability, network efficiency, security requirements, and portability concerns. It&#x27;s important to assess these factors and choose the appropriate load balancing solution accordingly.</p><h2 id="so-that-means-ingress-and-ingress-controller-do-not-have-exposing-port-feature"><a href="#so-that-means-ingress-and-ingress-controller-do-not-have-exposing-port-feature" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>so, that means Ingress and Ingress-controller do not have &quot;exposing port&quot; feature,</h2><p>therefore they need another service like LoadBalancer.</p><p>Yes, that&#x27;s correct. Ingress and Ingress controllers do not have built-in capabilities to directly expose ports or provide external access to services.
