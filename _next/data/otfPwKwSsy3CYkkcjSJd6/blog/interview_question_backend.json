This means that passwords should be encrypted or hashed before storing them in a database.

When a user creates an account and sets a password, the password is immediately hashed and stored in the database. When the user logs in, the entered password is hashed and compared with the stored hash. If the hashes match, the user is granted access to the account. However, even with hashing, it is important to use a strong hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or scrypt, to prevent brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks.\"}),(0,e.jsx)(a.p,{children:\"Another important aspect of password storage is salting. A salt is a random string of characters that is added to a password before hashing.

Salting is especially important if the same hashing algorithm is used for all passwords in the database.\"}),(0,e.jsx)(a.p,{children:\"In addition to proper password storage techniques, it is also important to enforce strong password policies. This includes requiring users to create complex passwords, such as those containing a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

Additionally, services should implement measures to prevent password reuse, such as blocking users from using a password they have used before.\"}),(0,e.jsx)(a.p,{children:\"Finally, it is important to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide an additional layer of security.

A system call is a form of interprocess communication that provides a standard interface between user-level processes and the operating system.\"}),(0,e.jsx)(a.p,{children:\"The primary purpose of system calls is to provide a safe and efficient way for user-level processes to access kernel-level resources. For instance, when an application needs to read data from a file, it will call a system call to request that the kernel provides access to the file. The system call will then initiate a context switch, where the kernel takes control of the CPU, performs the requested operation, and returns the result back to the application.\"}),(0,e.jsx)(a.p,{children:\"There are several types of system calls, including process control, file management, device management, and network management. Process control system calls are used to create, modify, and terminate processes. File management system calls are used to create, read, write, and delete files. Device management system calls are used to interact with hardware devices such as printers, disks, and keyboards. Network management system calls are used to establish and manage network connections.\"}),(0,e.jsx)(a.p,{children:\"Some common examples of system calls include open, read, write, close, fork, exec, wait, and exit. The open system call is used to open a file and returns a file descriptor, which is used to read or write data to the file. The read and write system calls are used to read and write data to a file, respectively. The fork system call is used to create a new process, while the exec system call is used to replace the current process image with a new one. The wait system call is used to wait for a child process to terminate, and the exit system call is used to terminate the current process.\"}),(0,e.jsx)(a.p,{children:\"In conclusion, system calls are a crucial aspect of modern operating systems and provide a standardized interface between user-level processes and the kernel. They allow applications to access kernel-level resources safely and efficiently, enabling them to perform tasks such as file and device input/output, process management, memory management, and network communication.

By using a binary format, HTTP/2 reduces the number of bytes required to transmit data, resulting in faster page load times.\"}),(0,e.jsx)(a.p,{children:\"Another key feature of HTTP/2 is that it supports multiplexing. In HTTP/1.x, only one request could be sent at a time, which led to slower page load times.
